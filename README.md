The Coal and Lignite Production Dashboard is a powerful tool that visualizes the production data of coal and lignite across Indian states and union territories.
It provides insights into production volumes, ownership types (government vs private), geographical distribution, and the type of mining methods (open-cast, underground, or mixed).
Using interactive visuals like bar charts, doughnut charts, and maps, the dashboard allows users to explore production patterns and identify key trends in the Indian energy sector.
